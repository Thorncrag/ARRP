# Current Task Handoff

This file is the first place to check when an ARRP audit, source-development pass, or long-running drafting task resumes in a new chat. It exists to prevent chat-context loss from causing the next agent to infer the wrong active issue from recent commits, GitHub Project rows, or nearby source-development markers.

## Current Task

| Field | Entry |
| --- | --- |
| Handoff state | Open |
| Active issue/task | Component Registry Stage 1 activation and publication transaction |
| Audit type/tier | Design-locked implementation |
| Started | 2026-07-29 21:49:59 -0400 |
| Last checkpoint | 2026-07-30 11:27:12 -0400 |
| User request | Execute the approved Stage 1 activation transaction through the reviewed activation and closeout pull requests while keeping automation Paused. |
| Scope | Accepted Component Registry candidate; 97-move future-tree migration; exact reference reconciliation; candidate-to-active transition; GOV-2026-020; public Console regeneration; GitHub review, checks, merges, canonical readback, and the fixed owner-local activation receipt. Runtime materialization and production execution remain excluded. |
| Files touched | Accepted candidate and migration files; Component Registry validator, finalizer, focused tests, governance registry and log, public Console sources/data, Project Integrity and Source Checker reports, and this handoff. |
| Completed steps | Committed the accepted candidate seed and opened draft PR #498; committed the 93 non-predecessor candidate-path moves in `e08b39e9798e6c6cba884eccb7925ee738792404`; reconciled current links and typed candidate migration readback; corrected the candidate Git self-reference validator; completed one report-only Source Checker pass across 2,055 URLs; rebuilt the fixed Integrity feed from a repository-validation observation with zero errors and three expected authenticated-readback warnings; generated the final current and complete 42-domain public Console as `project-console-b2b0b1a85945551b73ef`; recoverably retired only the exact superseded current-run stages; reconciled the disclosure-policy pin; refreshed the terminal 628-path, 976-reference activation-readiness receipt; corrected the remaining mechanical post-move consumer and test paths; passed 754 Python tests with 15 intentional skips, 58 Console frontend tests, 28 participation tests, repository Integrity, authoritative public-bundle disclosure, and an isolated strict public-site build; kept the registry candidate, nonauthoritative, nonexecutable, and in exact predecessor parity. |
| Next step | Run the exact final candidate bundle disclosure and Git/diff readback, freeze and push the final candidate parent, then create the single active child commit and stop for Benjamin's exact latest-head PR review. |
| Blockers/questions | No local candidate blocker is known. The activation merge, owner-local receipt, and closeout PR remain future gated steps. The four predecessors remain live until the active child commit; Stage 2 classifications and terminology remain deferred. |
| Validation status | In progress. Candidate validation, parity, and terminal readiness pass; the final public Console is current and complete; Project Integrity is 0 errors with 3 expected unavailable authenticated-readback warnings; Source Checker and Integrity projections are current and complete; full Python and frontend suites, strict public-site build, and exact public Console disclosure pass. Final candidate range disclosure, commit/push readback, PR checks, exact-head review, merge, and receipt readbacks remain pending. |

## Handoff Rules

1. Before starting or resuming a long audit, read this file after the governing Framework and Agent Operating Rules.
2. If this file identifies an `Open`, `Paused`, or `Blocked` issue or task, continue from that checkpoint unless the user gives newer contrary instructions.
3. If this file is inactive or stale and the user says "continue," ask which issue or task to continue instead of inferring from nearby repo state.
4. Update this file at the start of any long audit, after each major phase, before risky edits, and before any likely context handoff.
5. This file records continuation state only. It is not evidence that an agent, bot, automation chain, Codex task, or operating-system process is currently running. For automation, the sole host-side liveness authority is the operating-system-held dispatcher lease. Its owner record and heartbeat are diagnostic state, not another lock and not independent proof that work is running.
6. Use `Open` for an unfinished task with an exact continuation point; `Paused` when the same unfinished task is deliberately suspended with the responsible resumer and resumption condition recorded; `Blocked` when a concrete indispensable prerequisite prevents the next action, with the blocked action, prerequisite, and unblock trigger recorded; and `Inactive` only when no unfinished task handoff remains.
7. Successful closeout requires `Inactive` before the final report. Set the inactive sentinels exactly as shown in the current table: `Active issue/task`, `Audit type/tier`, `Started`, `User request`, `Scope`, `Files touched`, `Completed steps`, `Next step`, and `Blockers/questions` are `None.`; `Validation status` is `Not applicable.`; `Last checkpoint` may retain the clearing timestamp. The cleared checkpoint must be committed and synchronized on the canonical branch; an uncommitted or branch-only copy is insufficient. This file is not a completion ledger.
8. A required commit, push, review or merge, synchronization, publication, validation, or human-reserved decision that belongs to the same task keeps the handoff `Paused` or `Blocked`. If a required external step fails after an intended inactive closeout, reopen the checkpoint before ending.
9. A separate future human-review question belongs in the appropriate Action Item and issue workflow status and does not keep an otherwise completed task open.
10. Do not use GitHub issue comments as the ordinary audit-history record. Keep substantive audit history in the issue's sibling audit-history file; use the GitHub issue wrapper and Project fields for workflow status, links, score, last audit, next audit, rebaseline status, and change-audit flags.
