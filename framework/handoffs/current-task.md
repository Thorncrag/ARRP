# Current Task Handoff

This file is the first place to check when an ARRP audit, source-development pass, or long-running drafting task resumes in a new chat. It exists to prevent chat-context loss from causing the next agent to infer the wrong active issue from recent commits, GitHub Project rows, or nearby source-development markers.

## Current Task

| Field | Entry |
| --- | --- |
| Handoff state | Open |
| Active issue/task | Component Registry Stage 1 activation and publication transaction |
| Audit type/tier | Design-locked implementation |
| Started | 2026-07-29 21:49:59 -0400 |
| Last checkpoint | 2026-07-30 15:48:19 -0400 |
| User request | Execute the approved Stage 1 activation transaction through the reviewed activation and closeout pull requests while keeping automation Paused. |
| Scope | Accepted Component Registry candidate; 97-move future-tree migration; exact reference reconciliation; candidate-to-active transition; GOV-2026-020; public Console regeneration; GitHub review, checks, merges, canonical readback, and the fixed owner-local activation receipt. Runtime materialization and production execution remain excluded. |
| Files touched | Accepted candidate and migration files; Component Registry validator, finalizer, focused tests, governance registry and log, public Console sources/data, Project Integrity and Source Checker reports, and this handoff. |
| Completed steps | Committed and pushed final candidate C5 `e64ecee9d23a6ddea44ecd0638c60a29df4e541e` and deterministic active head `fd4b255478cd91f5243b34b953b4fa28e05b9492` to draft PR #498 after exact disclosure authorization and green local acceptance. Identified GitHub's impossible self-review condition because Benjamin owns both the PR and required review identity. Benjamin expressly approved replacing only that impossible event with authenticated owner manual-merge evidence. Implemented and focused-tested the truthful `github_owner_manual_merge` receipt model, preserved all earlier commits, committed corrected final candidate `33d1e46b564d67e04bf2c72f4f494ffea8e851b4`, produced its exact deterministic active overlay, refreshed both repository-bound Console feeds at the committed candidate, regenerated the active public Console, restored Project Integrity to zero errors with three expected authenticated-readback warnings, and recoverably retired every attributable current-run staging and rollback artifact through the guarded Trash gateway. |
| Next step | Commit the corrected deterministic active head, run its exact disclosure gate, push only the authorized refspec to PR #498, and wait for successful required checks. Benjamin must then inspect and manually merge that exact latest head in GitHub. After canonical synchronization, run the fixed finalizer and proceed to the closeout PR. |
| Blockers/questions | No local implementation blocker is known. The next human-reserved action is Benjamin's manual merge of the exact latest PR #498 head after required checks succeed. PAUSED, runtime materialization, production execution, Stage 2 classifications, and terminology remain unchanged or deferred. |
| Validation status | In progress. Corrected candidate is committed and validates exactly; active configuration validation, generated CODEOWNERS equality, 280 focused Python tests, Source Checker 2,055/2,055, Project Integrity 0 errors/3 expected unavailable authenticated-readback warnings, and current/complete 42-domain public Console generation all pass. Active commit, exact disclosure, push, checks, manual merge, receipt, and closeout remain pending. |

## Handoff Rules

1. Before starting or resuming a long audit, read this file after the governing Framework and Agent Operating Rules.
2. If this file identifies an `Open`, `Paused`, or `Blocked` issue or task, continue from that checkpoint unless the user gives newer contrary instructions.
3. If this file is inactive or stale and the user says "continue," ask which issue or task to continue instead of inferring from nearby repo state.
4. Update this file at the start of any long audit, after each major phase, before risky edits, and before any likely context handoff.
5. This file records continuation state only. It is not evidence that an agent, bot, automation chain, Codex task, or operating-system process is currently running. For automation, the sole host-side liveness authority is the operating-system-held dispatcher lease. Its owner record and heartbeat are diagnostic state, not another lock and not independent proof that work is running.
6. Use `Open` for an unfinished task with an exact continuation point; `Paused` when the same unfinished task is deliberately suspended with the responsible resumer and resumption condition recorded; `Blocked` when a concrete indispensable prerequisite prevents the next action, with the blocked action, prerequisite, and unblock trigger recorded; and `Inactive` only when no unfinished task handoff remains.
7. Successful closeout requires `Inactive` before the final report. Set the inactive sentinels exactly as shown in the current table: `Active issue/task`, `Audit type/tier`, `Started`, `User request`, `Scope`, `Files touched`, `Completed steps`, `Next step`, and `Blockers/questions` are `None.`; `Validation status` is `Not applicable.`; `Last checkpoint` may retain the clearing timestamp. The cleared checkpoint must be committed and synchronized on the canonical branch; an uncommitted or branch-only copy is insufficient. This file is not a completion ledger.
8. A required commit, push, review or merge, synchronization, publication, validation, or human-reserved decision that belongs to the same task keeps the handoff `Paused` or `Blocked`. If a required external step fails after an intended inactive closeout, reopen the checkpoint before ending.
9. A separate future human-review question belongs in the appropriate Action Item and issue workflow status and does not keep an otherwise completed task open.
10. Do not use GitHub issue comments as the ordinary audit-history record. Keep substantive audit history in the issue's sibling audit-history file; use the GitHub issue wrapper and Project fields for workflow status, links, score, last audit, next audit, rebaseline status, and change-audit flags.
