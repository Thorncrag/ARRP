# GitHub Workflow

GitHub is the project's authoritative workflow record. Active proposals, horizon proposals, release blockers, publication tasks, and contributor-facing suggestions should be visible as GitHub Issues and, where useful, on the project board.

The repository remains the authoritative substantive record. Proposal text, audit history, inventories, source records, proposed legislation, and framework rules belong in repo files and should be changed through normal repository edits or pull requests.

## Tracking Rule

Each active ARRP proposal or active horizon item should have a GitHub issue. The GitHub issue tracks discussion, assignment, contributor-facing workflow, and links back to the canonical repository record. The GitHub Project tracks structured workflow metadata. The canonical repo file records the adopted substance.

Milestones should not be assigned automatically to every proposal. A milestone means the issue is an obligation for that release phase. Proposal and horizon issues may remain unmilestoned until they are pulled into a specific release path.

## Project Fields

Use GitHub Project fields as the authoritative structured workflow metadata:

- `Area` identifies the primary ARRP area or governance/export category.
- `Workstream` distinguishes proposal development from project governance and operations.
- `Priority` records the current project priority.
- `Release blocker` records whether the item blocks the active release.
- `Status` records lifecycle and workflow position.
- `Score`, `Runs`, `Last audit`, and `Next audit` provide compact audit-status summaries.
- `Rebaseline status` records whether the proposal score is current under the governing rubric or needs a soft/hard rebaseline.
- `Change audit needed` records whether a developed proposal has an unresolved targeted Change Audit / Internal Remedy-Fit Audit marker.
- `Canonical page` links to the repository page or GitHub issue that carries the authoritative substance or active intake record.
- `Parent issue` and `Sub-issues progress` should be used for native GitHub parent/sub-issue tracking where work naturally breaks down into child issues.

Do not duplicate these fields as issue-body metadata or as labels. If a field value changes, update the GitHub Project field directly.

Use these options for audit-control fields:

- `Rebaseline status`: `Current`, `Current fixed status`, `Soft rebaseline needed`, `Hard rebaseline needed`, `Rebaseline complete`, `Not applicable`, `Unknown`.
- `Change audit needed`: `No`, `Yes`, `Pending review`, `Blocked`.

## Labels

Use labels sparingly. Labels should not duplicate Project fields.

- `kind:*` labels identify the type of issue, such as `kind: proposal` or `kind: horizon`.
- Temporary labels may be used for ad hoc contributor triage only when no existing Project field captures the need.
- Do not use `area:*`, `priority:*`, `stage:*`, `status:*`, or `release:*` labels unless the Project field model is deliberately changed.

## Sub-Issues

Use GitHub native sub-issues rather than Markdown task lists when a governance, release, audit, or publication item has meaningful child tasks. Parent issues should describe the umbrella objective and completion standard. Child issues should carry the executable work and close independently.

For the current public-release workflow, `Pre-publication final audit` and `Pre-publication technical` are the parent governance issues. Their detailed work should remain attached through GitHub native sub-issues so the Project board can stay compact while preserving task detail.

## Import Ledger

The proposal-to-GitHub migration ledger is maintained at [`inventory/github_issue_import.csv`](../inventory/github_issue_import.csv). It is a historical import/audit aid, not the live workflow tracker. Rows marked `created` have a GitHub issue URL. Rows marked `pending` still need individual GitHub tracking issues created and Project fields populated under the current field model. Legacy columns such as suggested labels should not be treated as current label policy.
